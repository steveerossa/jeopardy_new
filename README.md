# jeopardy_new
Jeopardy tv show project. I parsed through a JSON file of 60,000 Jeopardy TV Show questions answers, air dates, prizes etc I added the 
JSON file to a MongoDB, and manipulated from Node.js. I  used JADE and html to display the questions and other categories. Answers were 
displayed upon click.
